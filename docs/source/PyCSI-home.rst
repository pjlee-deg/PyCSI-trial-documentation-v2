About The Project
-----------------

``PyCSI`` is a Python library designed to help users use the CSI
software API. It provides classes that allow the user to connect to and
retrieve data from a CSI software model through single-line functions.

Assumptions and Limitations
---------------------------

1. ``PyCSI`` was written for Python 3.10, some functions may not work in
   other Python versions.
2. ``PyCSI`` works with the following software:

   -  ETABS v18 or higher
   -  SAP2000 v20 or higher
   -  SAFE v20 or higher

Download PyCSI

Getting Started
---------------

For instructions on how to setup and use ``PyCSI`` in your Python script
read the `Introduction and
Setup <docs/tutorials/notebooks/1_Introduction_and_Setup.ipynb>`__
tutorial file.

How to use PyCSI?
-----------------

**Video Tutorial: Coming soon.**

We have created a series of Jupyter Notebook tutorials to help you get
started with ``PyCSI`` and all its functions. You can find them in the
```tutorials`` </docs/tutorials/notebooks>`__ directory. See below for
instructions to open and use a Jupyter Notebook.

Jupyter Notebook?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to
create and share documents containing live code. This allows to make an
easy-to-read and code-enabled document which you can modify and run.

How to use a Jupyter Notebook?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Launching Jupyter Notebook:

   -  Using Anaconda Navigator: Open Anaconda Navigator and launch
      Jupyter Notebook.

      .. raw:: html

         <center>

      .. raw:: html

         </center>

   -  Using Command Line: Open the Anaconda Prompt:

      .. raw:: html

         <center>

      .. raw:: html

         </center>

      And type the following command:

      .. code:: console

         jupyter notebook

      This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web
      browser.

   -  Using PyCharm or VSCode. These IDEs have an integrated Jupyter
      Notebook integration. If you use any of these you can directly
      open the ``.ipynb`` file from the editor.

2. Opening a Notebook File:

   -  Navigate to the folder containing your ``.ipynb`` file and click
      on the file to open it.

      .. raw:: html

         <center>

      .. raw:: html

         </center>

3. Running a Cell:

   -  Click on a code cell to select it.

   -  Press Shift + Enter to execute the cell and see the output
      directly below it.

      .. raw:: html

         <center>

      .. raw:: html

         </center>
