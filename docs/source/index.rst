===================================

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Lumache hosts its documentation on Read the Docs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
